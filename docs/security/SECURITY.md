# FinConnectAI Security Documentation

‚ö†Ô∏è **IMPORTANT DISCLAIMER** ‚ö†Ô∏è

This security documentation is provided as a foundation for business adaptation. Businesses MUST:

1. **Customize Security Controls**
   - All security controls must be configured according to your organization's security policies
   - Default security settings shown here are for demonstration purposes only
   - Businesses must implement their own security controls as required

2. **Data Protection**
   - Encryption algorithms and key lengths must be set according to your organization's requirements
   - Key management must follow your organization's security standards
   - Data retention policies must comply with your compliance requirements

3. **Access Control**
   - RBAC roles and permissions must be defined according to your organization's access policies
   - Authentication mechanisms must meet your organization's security requirements
