# FinConnectAI Architecture

## System Overview

FinConnectAI is a modular, microservices-based fraud detection system built with Python. It combines real-time transaction analysis, currency conversion, and regulatory compliance.

## Architecture Components

### 1. Core Services

#### Fraud Detection Service
- Located in `agents/fraud_agent.py`
- Real-time transaction analysis
- ML model integration
- Risk scoring and decision making

#### Currency Service
- Located in `app/currency_exchange.py` and `app/currency_cache.py`
- Real-time exchange rates
- Rate caching and updates
- Multi-currency support

#### Compliance Service
- Located in `app/compliance.py`
- Regulatory compliance checks
- Documentation generation
- Audit logging

### 2. API Layer

#### FastAPI Backend
- Located in `app/api_routes.py`
- RESTful API endpoints
- JWT authentication
- Rate limiting
- Request validation

### 3. User Interface

#### Gradio UI
- Located in `ui/gradio_fraud_explain.py`
- Interactive fraud analysis
- Real-time currency conversion
- Performance metrics visualization

### 4. Data Layer

#### Database
- PostgreSQL for persistent storage
- Redis for caching
- Transaction history
- Audit logs

graph TD
    A[Client Browser] --> B[Gradio UI]
    B --> C[FastAPI Backend]
    
    subgraph Backend Services
        C --> D[Fraud Evaluator]
        C --> E[Currency Exchange]
        C --> F[Compliance Manager]
        
        D --> G[ML Model]
        E --> H[Rate Cache]
        F --> I[Compliance Rules]
    end
    
    subgraph External Services
        H --> J[Exchange Rate API]
    end
```

### Data Flow
```mermaid

    participant U as User
    participant G as Gradio UI
    participant A as API
    participant F as Fraud Eval
    participant C as Currency
    participant CO as Compliance
    
    U->>G: Submit Transaction
    G->>A: API Request
    A->>F: Check Fraud
    A->>C: Convert Currency
    C->>C: Check Cache
    C-->>A: Rate Response
    A->>CO: Verify Compliance
    CO-->>A: Compliance Status
    A-->>G: Analysis Result
    G-->>U: Display Result
```

### Component Dependencies
```mermaid

    A[Gradio UI] --> B[FastAPI]
    B --> C[Fraud Evaluator]
    B --> D[Currency Exchange]
    B --> E[Compliance]
    D --> F[Rate Cache]
    E --> G[Rules Engine]
```

## Data Flow

1. **Transaction Analysis Flow**
   ```
   Client Request
   → API Gateway
   → Fraud Detection Service
   → ML Model Prediction
   → Compliance Check
   → Response Generation
   → Client Response
   ```

2. **Currency Conversion Flow**
   ```
   Rate Request
   → Cache Check
   → Exchange Rate API (if needed)
   → Rate Update
   → Cache Update
   → Response
   ```

## Security Architecture

### Authentication & Authorization
- JWT-based authentication
- Role-based access control
- API key management
- Request signing

### Data Security
- Encryption at rest
- TLS for data in transit
- Secure key storage
- Regular security audits

## Scalability

### Horizontal Scaling
- Stateless API design
- Load balancer ready
- Distributed caching
- Database sharding

### Performance Optimization
- Response caching
- Async operations
- Background tasks
- Rate limiting

## Monitoring & Logging

### System Monitoring
- Performance metrics
- Error tracking
- Resource usage
- API latency

### Audit Logging
- Transaction logs
- Security events
- Compliance checks
- System changes

## Deployment Architecture

### Docker Containers
```yaml
services:
  api:
    build: .
    ports:
      - "8000:8000"
    depends_on:
      - db
      - redis
  
  db:
    image: postgres:13
    volumes:
      - postgres_data:/var/lib/postgresql/data
  
  redis:
    image: redis:6
    volumes:
      - redis_data:/data
```

### Cloud Infrastructure
