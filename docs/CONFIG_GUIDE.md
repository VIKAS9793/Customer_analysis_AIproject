# Configuration Guide

This guide explains how to configure the application using the provided template files.

## Environment Variables

The `.env.example` file contains all necessary environment variables. Copy this file to `.env` and replace the placeholder values:

- `DATABASE_URL`: Replace with your actual database connection string
- `MODEL_PATH`: Replace with the path to your machine learning model
- `LOG_LEVEL`: Set to desired log level (INFO, DEBUG, ERROR)
- `PORT`: Set to desired application port

## Configuration File

The `config.sample.json` file contains the main application configuration. Replace all `REPLACE_WITH_` placeholders with your actual values:

- Database credentials
- Model paths
- Logging configuration

## Important Notes

- Never commit actual credentials or sensitive information to version control
- Always replace placeholder values before deployment
- Keep configuration files secure and accessible only to authorized personnel
- Consider using a secrets management solution for production environments

## Security Best Practices

1. Store sensitive information in environment variables
2. Use a secrets management system for production
3. Regularly rotate credentials and access keys
4. Never hardcode sensitive information in configuration files
5. Use proper access controls for configuration files
