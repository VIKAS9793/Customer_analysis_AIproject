        permissions:
          - "*"
      analyst:           # Must be customized by business
        permissions:
          - "read"
          - "write"
      viewer:            # Must be customized by business
        permissions:
          - "read"
```

## 2. Compliance Customization

### Required Customizations:

1. **Data Retention**

   - DPDP Act compliance
   - Industry-specific regulations
   
3. **Audit Requirements**
   - Audit log configuration
   - Audit trail retention
   - Audit access controls

### Example Configuration:
```yaml
compliance:
  data_retention:
    transactions: 365  # Must be configured by business
    audit_logs: 365    # Must be configured by business
    access_logs: 90    # Must be configured by business
    
  regulations:
    gdpr:
      enabled: true    # Must be configured by business
      retention: 365   # Must be configured by business
      
    dpdp:
      enabled: true    # Must be configured by business
      retention: 365   # Must be configured by business
```

## 3. Monitoring Customization

### Required Customizations:

1. **Alert Thresholds**
   - Transaction volume thresholds
   - Error rate thresholds
   - Performance thresholds
   
2. **Notification Systems**
   - Alert channels
   - Escalation policies
   - Notification templates
   
3. **Metrics Collection**
   - Collection intervals
   - Retention periods
   - Alert conditions

### Example Configuration:
```yaml
monitoring:
  thresholds:
    transaction_volume: 10000  # Must be configured by business
    error_rate: 0.01         # Must be configured by business
    response_time: 200       # Must be configured by business
    
  notifications:
    channels:
      - "email"            # Must be configured by business
      - "slack"           # Must be configured by business
      - "teams"           # Must be configured by business
    
  metrics:
    collection_interval: 60  # Must be configured by business
    retention_days: 365     # Must be configured by business
```

## Important Notes

1. **Security First**
   - Always start with your organization's security policies
   - Never use default values in production
   - Regularly review and update security settings

2. **Compliance Check**
   - Ensure all configurations comply with regulations
   - Regularly audit compliance settings
   - Maintain proper documentation

3. **Custom Implementation**
   - All values must be customized for production
   - Default values are for demonstration only
   - Regular security reviews are required

4. **Documentation**
   - Maintain configuration documentation
   - Document all changes
   - Keep audit trails
