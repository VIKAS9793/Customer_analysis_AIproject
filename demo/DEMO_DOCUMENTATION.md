The FinConnectAI project is a demonstration tool designed to showcase advanced customer analytics capabilities for financial institutions. This demo application illustrates key features including customer insights generation, fraud detection, KYC verification, and compliance checks with a special focus on Indian market requirements.

## 2. Disclaimers

### 2.1 Demo Purpose
**THIS IS A DEMONSTRATION TOOL ONLY.** This application is designed exclusively for stakeholder presentations and feature demonstrations. It is not intended for production use, handling of real customer data, or making actual business decisions.

### 2.2 Data Disclaimer
All data presented in this demo is synthetic and generated for illustration purposes only. No real customer data is used or processed. Any resemblance to actual persons, transactions, or business entities is purely coincidental.

### 2.3 Regulatory Compliance
While this demo references regulatory thresholds and compliance frameworks, it should not be considered a definitive source of regulatory guidance. The thresholds and requirements shown are approximations based on publicly available information and may not reflect the most current regulatory standards.

### 2.4 Security Notice
This demo application has not undergone security auditing or penetration testing required for production systems. It should never be deployed in an environment with access to sensitive information or production systems.

### 2.5 Performance Limitations
The demo is optimized for presentation purposes and not for scale or performance. It may not handle large volumes of data or concurrent users in the way a production system would.
