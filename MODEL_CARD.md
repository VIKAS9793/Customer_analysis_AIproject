# FinConnectAI Model Card

## Model Information

### Model Architecture
- Primary Model: gpt-4.5
- Backup Model: claude-3.7-sonnet
- Context Window: 1M tokens
- Hallucination Reduction: Enabled
- Explainability: Required

## Ethical Considerations

### Bias Prevention
1. Demographic Parity Testing
   - Test cases represent diverse user profiles
   - No systemic skew in predictions
   - Regular bias audits
   - Minimum 500 test cases per demographic group
   - Regular fairness impact assessments

2. Human-in-the-Loop
   - Required for high-risk decisions (> 0.7 confidence)
   - Review threshold: > 0.7 confidence
   - Audit trail maintained
   - Maximum 24-hour review SLA

### Fairness Metrics
- Prediction distribution across demographics
- Decision consistency
- Error rate analysis
- Bias detection
- Demographic parity gap < 0.1
- Equal opportunity difference < 0.1
- Statistical parity difference < 0.1

### Bias Mitigation Strategies
1. Data Collection
   - Balanced dataset collection
   - Regular demographic rebalancing
   - Synthetic data generation for underrepresented groups

2. Model Training
   - Regular fairness-aware training
   - Bias correction techniques
   - Adversarial debiasing

3. Post-processing
   - Demographic parity enforcement
   - Equal opportunity enforcement
   - Calibration across demographics

### Regular Audits
1. Monthly fairness audits
2. Quarterly bias impact assessments
3. Annual comprehensive reviews
4. External audit certification every 6 months
